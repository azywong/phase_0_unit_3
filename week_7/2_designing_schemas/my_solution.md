## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 


I am modeling users to drivers license numbers (on to one), each user can have one license and each license can be linked to one user


and designers to collections (many to many), each designer can have many collections

## Release 5: Reflection

### What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I read through the directions and did a bit of searching about databases on my own since this is all new to me.  I had to read through the information several times to understand it since I was totally unfamiliar with databases to start with.


### What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I basically just went through the directions.  I googled a few definitions, but I didn't majorly use any outside resources this time.


### What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

I was having trouble visualizing how data bases connected, but the schema really helped!  Also I'm not super confident about how to structure databases and connecting databases, but hopefully fiddling with the schema and getting more practice will help!


### Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I hadn't worked with databases before, so I guess this is all new to me!


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I think I could definitely use more practice, but I'm alright with the learning competencies!


### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I enjoyed learning about databases and being able to work with something visual.


### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
None!
